# ICS4U CPT: NATO Alliance Countries Military and Economy Data

The dataset that I am using is a dataset from NATO, which is a group of 30 countries in a military alliance consisting of countries such as the USA, Canada, and 28 European Countries.This dataset includes a variety of military and economic data about these countries between the years 2014 and 2021 - a total of 8 years. From this data, I used 3 specific values which are Military Personnel, GDP, and Military Spending to create a total of three charts - a PiChart, BarChart, and LineChart. I selected this dataset for this project because I find military like this be interesting - especially how the USA spends more on their military than double of the rest of NATO combined. This data gives you an idea of who the major players within NATO are.
