# ICS4U CPT (Edit this)

The dataset that I am using is a dataset from NATO, which is a group of 30 countries in a military alliance consisting of countries such as the USA, Canada, and 28 European Countries.This dataset includes a variety of military and economic data about these countries between the years 2014 and 2021 - a total of 8 years. From this data, I used 3 specific values which are Military Personnel, GDP, and Military Spending to create a total of three charts - a PiChart, BarChart, and LineChart. I selected this dataset for this project because I find data like this be interesting - especially how the USA spends more on their military than double of the rest of NATO combined.
